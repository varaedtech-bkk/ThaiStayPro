🔹 Updated Prompt (Include Visa Reminder Feature) 
I need a full-stack web application built using Next.js (React + TypeScript) for the frontend and Node.js (Express + Prisma + PostgreSQL) for the backend. 
📌 Core Idea:
This app will provide reminder services where users can set up notifications for important dates like visa expiry, passport renewal, bill payments, and personal tasks.

🔹 Core Features
1️⃣ User Features (Frontend + Backend)
✅ User Authentication (Signup, Login, Forgot Password) using JWT & bcrypt ✅ User Dashboard (View & Manage Reminders) ✅ Create, Edit, Delete Reminders ✅ Visa Expiry Tracking: Users can enter their visa details (e.g., visa type, expiry date, country) and receive alerts before expiration ✅ Push Notifications for Visa & Other Reminders ✅ Advanced Notification Options (Email, SMS for Pro users) ✅ Free & Pro Plans:
* Free Plan: Limited reminders, basic notifications
* Pro Plan: Unlimited reminders, email & SMS alerts
2️⃣ Payment System (Pro Plan Upgrade)
✅ Stripe Integration for subscription payments ✅ User Subscription Tracking in PostgreSQL ✅ Auto-Renewal Handling for Pro Plan
3️⃣ Admin Dashboard (Next.js + API)
✅ View Total Users, Pro Users, Free Users ✅ Track Revenue & Payment History ✅ Monitor Active Users & Reminders ✅ Visa Reminder Statistics (How many users set visa-related reminders, upcoming expirations, etc.)
4️⃣ Database Design (PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM)
✅ Users Table: Stores user accounts ✅ Reminders Table: Stores user reminders ✅ Visa Table: Stores visa-related reminders with fields like:
* visa_type (Tourist, Work, Student, etc.)
* expiry_date
* country ✅ Payments Table: Tracks subscription payments
5️⃣ Deployment & Configuration
✅ Backend on Replit (Express API, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL) ✅ Frontend on Vercel (Next.js) ✅ Secure API Routes with Authentication

🔹 Additional Notes  
Please make sure to include:
* Visa Reminder Feature (Users can input visa details & get expiry alerts)
* User-Friendly UI for Adding Visa Details
* Option for Admins to See Visa Expiry Trends
